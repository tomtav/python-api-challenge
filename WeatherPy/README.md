## Background
Here I visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I accomplish this by utilizing the [CityPy Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities to answer the fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?".

## Observations

1. The further north or south from the equator you travel the location's temperature gets cooler. This means that the location's temperature has definite inverse correlation with it's latitude. As expected, the closer you are to the equator the warmer the weather is for those locations closer to 0 degrees latitude.

2. It seems that the northern hemisphere is warmer during this time of year than the southern hemisphere.

3. There doesn't seem to be any signification coorelation between cloudiness and latitude, but there is definitely a positive correlation between wind speeds and latitude.
