# WeatherPy

## Background
Here I visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I accomplish this by utilizing the [CityPy Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities to answer the fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?".
